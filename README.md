## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<--ğŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Erick Luiz (aka Brambolo), a student of Systems Analysis and Development, passionate about technology and always curious to understand how things work behind the scenes.

ğŸ’» I'm focused on building a solid foundation in programming, computational logic, data structures, and software development. Iâ€™m especially interested in areas like software engineering, databases, and artificial intelligence.

ğŸš€ My goal is to grow as a tech professional by learning continuously, working on practical projects, and exploring different paths within the IT field to find the right specialization for me.

ğŸ“š Currently, I'm dedicated to my studies and hands-on learning to keep up with the fast-paced world of technology.
